Based on my imageFind project https://github.com/erfg12/imageFind

Finds the splash bitmap on screen, shift + right click's on the location and then presses the 1 key to re-cast your line.

Use the hot key CTRL + S to start or stop the bot.

Benefits to using this bot - not version specific. Unless they change the splash image.
